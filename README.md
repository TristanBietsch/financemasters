### The Motivation

Knowledge of finance is highly regarded in the job market. Finance is one of few fields whose employee pays generous amount of money. 
> Finance is one of the highest-paying sectors in the US economy, and the industry draws many job seekers for precisely that reason. Financial managers, for example, are paid a median of $127,990 per year, and according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, employment for financial managers is projected to rise 19 percent between 2016 and 2026, which is faster than the average for other occupations….

_-source: [“Highest Paying Finance Jobs” - Glassdoor.com ](http://bit.ly/glassdoor-highpayingjobs)_, published on 14 May 2019

> Finance is critical to any economy. No wealthy nation is without a sophisticated finance industry and none of the world’s poorest countries have one. The benefits of an efficient industry are obvious; economic growth, social mobility, and better pensions and savings. The financial crisis of 2008 should be a lesson to all of us. If the finance industry fails to perform its purpose well, instability sets in.

### Many ways of learning finance

The traditional way of learning finance is to study at a university. Unfortunately, finance is a vast subject and involves tons of elements which means that your time at university would not be enough to cover every essential thing you need to understand. Now, using the books available you can increase your skills by taking the advantage of books, material, and certification that will help you launch a successful career in finance.

You might also want to learn finance eventhough your background is engineering, public policy, etc.

**Finance is Everywhere**

>It doesn’t matter if you work in tech or education, consulting or advertising. Your company needs cash flow to do things like pay everyone’s salary, distribute dividends, and reinvest in product innovation.Even if you don’t manage a budget yourself, finance is at the core of business decision-making. If you’re pitching a project or angling for additional funding, understanding and being able to communicate how you can turn that investment into revenue for your organization will help you make a more convincing argument.
